Launch Script Walkthrough
I have created a 
launch.ps1
 script to simplify starting the ACL project.

Changes
Created 
launch.ps1
 in the project root.
Verification Results
Automated Verification
Ran 
.\launch.ps1
 in PowerShell.

Fixed Issue: The user encountered a libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll missing error.

Resolution: Recompiled 
server.exe
 with -static linking and fixed PATH environment for g++.

Verified 
server.exe
 was updated.

Output confirmed:

Starting ACL Project...
Launching Server...
Launching Client...
Done! Server and Client should be running.
Processes were launched successfully.

How to Use
Double-click 
launch.ps1
 or run it from a PowerShell terminal:

.\launch.ps1
This will open the Server and Client windows automatically.
