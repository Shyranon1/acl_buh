Project ACL Walkthrough
Overview
I have successfully implemented the full solution for the ACL Project, including the C++ TSP Server and the Java MVC Client.

Files Created
C++ Server: 
server_tsp.cpp
Java Client (in client/ folder):
ApplicationLivraison.java
 (Main entry point)
Ville.java
, 
Camion.java
, 
ServiceReseau.java
, 
ComposantCarte.java
, 
LecteurDonnees.java
Data: 
villes.json
 (Sample data for 10 French cities)
How to Run
1. Start the C++ Server
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

./server
You should see "=== SERVEUR TSP DEMARRE (Port 8080) ==="

2. Start the Java Client
Open another terminal window and run:

java client.ApplicationLivraison
3. Usage
Click "1. Charger Données (JSON)".
A file dialog will open.
To load a single file: Select a 
.json
 file.
To load multiple files: Select a Directory (e.g., your 13_fichiers_JSON folder). The application will load ALL 
.json
 files inside it.
Road Types: The application automatically looks for .csv files with the same name as the JSONs (e.g., Bretagne.csv) in the same folder to load road types (Autoroute, Nationale, etc.).
The cities will appear on the map.
2 Trucks (Red and Blue) will be simulated.
Click "2. Calculer Tournées (C++)".
The Java client sends the cities to the C++ server.
The server calculates the optimal route using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
The map updates with the optimized routes drawn in Red and Blue.
Compilation (Already Done)
The project has been compiled for you:

server.exe (from g++ server_tsp.cpp -o server -lws2_32)
.class files in client/ (from javac client/*.java)
If you need to recompile:

g++ server_tsp.cpp -o server -lws2_32
javac client/*.java
